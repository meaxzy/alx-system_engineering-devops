#0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing ALX Software Engineering Project

#Learning Objectives Upon completion of this project, I am expected to:

-Create SSH keys for secure server access. -Understand the advantages of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash. -Master the use of while, until, and for loops. -Implement if, else, elif, and case condition statements. -Utilize the cut command for text manipulation. -Learn and apply file and other comparison operators.

#Requirements

-Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs -Interpreter: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS -File Ending: All files should end with a new line -README.md: A mandatory file explaining the project. -Script Executability: All Bash script files must be executable. -Shellcheck: Ensure all Bash scripts pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without errors. -First Line: The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash. -Second Line: The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose.

#Tasks

Create a SSH RSA key pair -Generate a RSA key pair. -Share the public key in 0-RSA_public_key.pub. -Fill the SSH public key field of your intranet profile. -Keep the private key secure for future server access.
