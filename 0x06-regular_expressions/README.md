#Regular Expression Project ALX Software Engineering Project

#Overview This project focuses on utilizing regular expressions (regex) using the Oniguruma library in Ruby. The goal is to match specific patterns and apply regular expressions to various scenarios. The project includes scripts for different tasks, each emphasizing a particular aspect of regex.

#Project Structure 0x06-regular_expressions/ 0-simply_match_school.rb: Script to match the word "School." 1-repetition_token_0.rb: Script to match repetitions. 2-repetition_token_1.rb: Script to match repetitions. 3-repetition_token_2.rb: Script to match repetitions. 4-repetition_token_3.rb: Script to match repetitions without square brackets. 5-beginning_and_end.rb: Script to match strings starting with 'h' and ending with 'n.' 6-phone_number.rb: Script to match a 10-digit phone number. 7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb: Script to match capital letters. 100-textme.rb: Advanced script to process TextMe app text messages transactions.

#Requirements Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs All files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS All files should end with a new line README.md file at the root is mandatory All Bash script files must be executable The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env ruby All regex must be built for the Oniguruma library

#Acknowledgements This project was created with the guidance of Sylvain Kalache and contributions from Guillaume Plessis. Special thanks to Neha Jain for providing insights into regex practices.
